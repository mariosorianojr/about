My research is grounded in hydrology and draws on theoretical frameworks and methodologies from sustainability science and applied data science. I am interested in questions that revolve around the complex interlinkages surrounding water as a natural resource, an environmental driver, and a pillar of human well-being. I employ high fidelity hydrological modeling, geospatial analysis, machine learning, and various field data collection and stakeholder engagement techniques to probe questions about water quantity and quality from a human-environment systems perspective.

Our audio series, <i>Carried by Water</i>, is out now! Listen via the link above. As part of the Blue Lab's Climate Stories Incubator, I created the audio series to explore the role of storytelling in synthesizing and communicating key lessons learned from scholarly research and lived experiences of disasters. Season 1, "Super Typhoon Haiyan / Yolanda, 10 Years On” (2023-2024) explores the socio-cultural legacies, scientific advances and political lessons learned in the decade since Super typhoon Haiyan / Yolanda made landfall in the central Philippines as one of the strongest and costliest storms ever recorded. Season 2, “Conversations about Retreat” (2025)  focuses on climate-driven retreat, with stories from people and scientists grappling with relocation and displacement in the face of increasing risk. Through the voices of homeowners in New Jersey who relocated after experiencing Superstorm Sandy and Hurricane Ida, we explore the personal, institutional and scientific drivers of managed retreat from areas deemed to be too hazardous to sustain because of sea level rise, increased flooding and more intense storms. This project explores evolving relations between water, weather and society, perceptions of home, climate change, the role of science and risk communication, and the variegated meanings of resilience and "build back better".

</p>
<p align="left"> 
Hydrologic processes have traditionally been modeled using physically based approaches that utilize the numerical solution of differential equations. One challenge with such physically based modeling is that as the models expand into larger spatial scales or higher resolutions, the computational requirements can rapidly become intractable. Metamodels, or machine learning models trained to emulate the behavior of physically based models, offer a promising avenue to address this issue. Supervised by Dr. Reed Maxwell at the Integrated GroundWater Modeling Center, I am studying the complementary use of continental scale, physically based, integrated surface water and groundwater models and metamodels. I am currently examining the predictive performance and spatial transferability of metamodels in the Upper Colorado River Basin. Parallel to these computational approaches, I also collected water samples for independent validation of the models against tracer-based measurements.

</p>
<p align="left"> 
  The WATER Study, led by PI's Dr. James Saiers and Dr. Nicole Deziel, is an interdisciplinary research project that examines the impact of unconventional energy development on groundwater quality and public health in the Appalachian Basin. I developed high resolution, three-dimensional groundwater flow and contaminant transport models and machine learning metamodels for our  study areas in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. I compiled publicly available data and performed geospatial analyses to identify target areas for sampling, and I was also part of the field team that collected groundwater samples from domestic water wells. Through complementary approaches from hydrogeology and geochemistry, we aimed to better understand the mechanisms affecting groundwater quality in this region. In collaboration with epidemiologists, we are investigating novel, interdisciplinary, mechanistic approaches that leverage hydrological models and water quality observations to interpret adverse human health outcomes from exposures to chemicals used in the industry. The project hopes to develop a systematic, process-based platform supporting science-informed policy-making to safeguard local aquifers, protect public health, and promote environmental justice.

  This international study, led by PI Dr. Srikantha Herath, was a transdisciplinary research project that explored the impacts of climate change and socioeconomic pressures on the sustainability of the centuries-old Ifugao Rice Terraces in the Philippines and the Hani Rice Terraces in China. I first became involved with the project as an undergrad when, for my senior research with Prof. Peter Castro, I calculated water budget components for the terraces and simulated the influence of various engineering design components (terrace wall height, slope, presence of internal drains) on the subsurface water redistribution in a single terrace using two-dimensional cross-section models. I continued to work with the project after college, becoming heavily involved in the selection, instrumentation, and three-year monitoring of an experimental headwater catchment in Ifugao. For my master's thesis, I constructed an integrated surface water-groundwater-slope stability model of the experimental catchment to assess the potential impacts under several climate and land-use change scenarios. Throughout the project, we conducted interviews and focus group discussions with indigenous farmers, government officials, and other local stakeholders to continuously reevaluate the relevance of our research questions and incorporate community concerns into our objectives.
