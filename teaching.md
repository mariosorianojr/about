Through teaching, I aim to equip students with fundamental principles of scientific inquiry and transferable problem-solving skills. My approaches span the range of lectures and laboratory-style classes, hands-on coding sessions, and more recently, online courses. I am also actively involved with extracurricular teaching, mainly through writing workshops and language partnerships.

<br/><br/>

### Institute of Civil Engineering, University of the Philippines - Diliman

* Instructor of record, 2012-2014 
: - Undergraduate courses - *Statics of Rigid Bodies* (ES 11), *Dynamics of Rigid Bodies* (ES 12), *Mechanics of Deformable Bodies* (ES 13), *Fluid Mechanics* (ES 15 & CE 15)
* From 2010-2012, as an undergrad at UPD-ICE, I worked as a Teaching Assistant for the only general education course offered by the department at the time, *Forces at Work* (ES 10).  I helped facilitate experiments to test non-engineering students' prototypes of various engineering structures. The experience was a lot of fun, and it turned out to be a wonderful training ground for communicating disciplinary concepts to a general audience!

### Undergraduate research mentorship

During my time as an instructor at UPD-ICE, I served as a mentor for the following undergraduate students in their senior research projects:
* Luigi Cruz - Determination of head loss through a pipe-chamber junction using computational fluid dynamics (2013-2014)
* Bredith Bucton - Modeling the surface and groundwater flow response to climatic and land-use change on a cascade of rice paddies (2013-2014)
* Arlene Co - Hydrologic response to climatic variations of a cascade of terraces (2012-2013)
