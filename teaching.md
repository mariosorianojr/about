Through teaching, I aim to equip students with fundamental principles of scientific inquiry and transferable problem-solving skills. My approaches span the range of lectures and laboratory-style classes, hands-on coding sessions, and more recently, online courses. I am also involved with extracurricular teaching through outreach, writing workshops, and language partnerships. I aspire to model excellence and inclusivity in my teaching practice inside and outside the classroom, and it is my hope that my teaching inspires students to reflect on how their unique identities, values, perspectives, and experiences are essential for solving today's complex challenges.

### Institute of Civil Engineering, University of the Philippines - Diliman

* Instructor of record, 2012-2014 
: - Undergraduate courses - *Statics of Rigid Bodies* (ES 11), *Dynamics of Rigid Bodies* (ES 12), *Mechanics of Deformable Bodies* (ES 13), *Fluid Mechanics* (ES 15 & CE 15)
* From 2010-2012, as an undergrad at UPD-ICE, I worked as a Teaching Assistant for the only general education course offered by the department at the time, *Forces at Work* (ES 10).  I helped facilitate experiments to test non-engineering students' prototypes of various engineering structures. The experience was a lot of fun, and it turned out to be a wonderful training ground for communicating disciplinary concepts to a general audience!
