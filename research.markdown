I utilize hydrological modeling, geospatial analysis, machine learning, and field data collection in my research to answer questions about water quality and quantity. My doctoral dissertation focuses on developing a quantitative framework for evaluating groundwater contamination risks from unconventional oil and gas development in the Appalachian Basin.

  The WATER Study, led by PI's Dr. James Saiers and Dr. Nicole Deziel, is a multidisciplinary research project that examines the impact of unconventional energy development on groundwater water quality and public health. I am developing high resolution, three-dimensional groundwater flow and contaminant transport models for our  study areas in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. I compiled publicly available data and performed geospatial analyses to identify target areas for sampling, and I also went out with the field team to collect groundwater samples from domestic pumping wells. Through complementary approaches from hydrogeology and geochemistry, we hope to better understand the mechanisms affecting groundwater quality in this region. From our findings, we hope to develop a process-based platform for quantifying overall risks and safeguarding local aquifers.

  This international study, led by PI Dr. Srikantha Herath, was a transdisciplinary research project that explored the impacts of climate change and socioeconomic drivers on the sustainability of the centuries-old Ifugao Rice Terraces in the Philippines and the Hani Rice Terraces in China. I first became involved with the project as an undergrad when, for my senior research with Prof. Peter Castro, I calculated water budget components for the terraces and simulated the influence of various engineering design components (terrace wall height, slope, presence of internal drains, and others) on the subsurface water redistribution in a single terrace using two-dimensional cross-section models. I continued to work with the project after college, and I was heavily involved in the selection, instrumentation, and monitoring of an experimental catchment in Ifugao. For my master's thesis, I constructed an integrated surface water-groundwater-slope stability model of the experimental catchment to assess the potential impacts under several climate and land-use change scenarios. Throughout the project, we conducted interviews and focus group discussions with indigenous farmers and other local stakeholders to continuously reevaluate the relevance of our research questions and incorporate community concerns into our objectives.
