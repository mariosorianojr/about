<p>
  Welcome to my site!
</p>
  I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [High Meadows Environmental Institute](https://environment.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University. I study the relationships between human systems and the movement of water. In particular, I am interested in questions related to how human activities alter hydrologic fluxes, and vice versa, how water itself shapes human adaptation. Ultimately, I would like to examine whether such interactions lead to pathways towards sustainability.

  I enjoy photography, reading, and learning languages during my free time.
