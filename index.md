<p>
  Welcome to my site!
</p>
  I am an Assistant Professor at the National University of Singapore's [Department of Geography](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/geog/). My research looks at the relationships between human systems and the movement of water. In particular, I am interested in questions related to how human activities alter hydrologic fluxes, and vice versa, how water itself shapes human adaptation. Ultimately, I aim to probe whether such interactions lead to pathways towards sustainability.

  I enjoy photography, reading, listening to podcasts, and taking long walks during my free time.
