<p>
  Welcome to my site!
</p>
  I am a PhD candidate in Environmental Hydrology at the Saiers lab in the [Yale School of the Environment](https://environment.yale.edu). I study the relationships between human systems and the movement of water. In particular, I am interested in questions related to how human activities alter hydrologic fluxes, and vice versa, how water itself shapes human adaptation. Ultimately, I would like to probe whether such interactions lead to pathways towards sustainability.

  I enjoy photography, reading, and learning languages during my free time.
